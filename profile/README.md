![ISAAC for Healthcare](../docs/source/isaac-for-healthcare-cover.png)

**Nvidia Isaac for Healthcare is the 3-computer solution for healthcare robotics**, allowing simulation, training and deployment of AI solutions. It extends and tailors [Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) and [Isaac Lab](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-lab) and [Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) to enable multi-scale simulation from anatomy to sensors, surgical instruments, robotic systems, operating rooms, intensive care units, labs, sterile processing departments (SPD), and full hospital environments. NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare leverages [Nvidia Holoscan](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan) for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation and Sim2Real deployment of trained algorithms and policies.

NVIDIA Isaac for Healthcare is a domain-specific framework built on top of [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim), [Nvidia Isaac Lab](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/lab), [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/) and [Nvidia Holoscan](https://github.com/nvidia-holoscan), enabling developers to design, simulate, test, train and deploy AI-enabled robots and autonomous systems, and generate synthetic data across:
- **Therapeutics**: e.g., surgical robotics, interventional radiology and radiotherapy
- **Diagnostics**: e.g., ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), cone-beam CT (CBCT)
- **Hospital & patient care**: e.g., hospitals, operating rooms and intensive care units with medication delivery, supply transport, disinfection robots, cobots
- **Rehabilitation & assistive technologies**: e.g., physical therapy robots, exoskeletons, etc.
